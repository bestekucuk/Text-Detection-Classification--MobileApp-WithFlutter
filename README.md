## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to develop a mobile application that harnesses advanced machine learning technologies for text detection and classification. Initially, the application utilizes Google's ML Kit to detect text from images within the mobile app interface. This feature enables the extraction of textual information from various image sources, enhancing the app's usability in diverse scenarios. Then, a custom Natural Language Processing (NLP) model predicts text categories.
